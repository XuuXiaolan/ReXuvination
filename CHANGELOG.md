# v1.0.0

- Optimised all I could with every base game collision type, added optimisation patches for the following:
  - BridgeTriggerType2
  - GrabbableObjectPhysicsTrigger
  - InteractTrigger
  - KillLocalPlayer
  - Landmine
  - OutOfBoundsTrigger
  - TerrainObstacleTrigger
  - ToggleFogTrigger
  - CompanyMonsterCollisionDetect.

## v0.4.0

- Optimised `EnemyAICollisionDetect` even further by making it so that enemies that don't typically collide with other enemies don't send eachother callbacks unless there actually is an interaction.
- i.e. a bunch of hoarding bugs next to eachother won't be spamming eachother unnecessary collision callbacks because they can't collide with eachother anymore.
